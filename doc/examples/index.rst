Examples
========

This page provides a series of examples, tutorials and recipes for using Mixtape.

Each subsection is a notebook.  To open these notebooks in a "live" IPython session
and execute the documentation interactively, you need to download the repository
and start the IPython notebook.

If you installed `Mixtape` from source, you will need to navigate to
:code:`path-to-mixtape/examples`. The notebook files for these examples
and the notebooks are available in the top level `examples folder
<https://github.com/rmcgibbo/mixtape/tree/master/examples>`_ on github
as well. In the directory with the notebook files, start an IPython
notebook server:

.. code-block:: python
  
   $ ipython notebook


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :titlesonly:
   :glob:
